# Social Web

---

Julien Genestoux - Superfeedr

## Social Web is broken

+	have to choose between friends and networks you like
+	don't have to do that with phone calls
+	networks act as gatekeepers
+	people end up using many different networks, no way to link them
+	we'll all probably outlive Facebook, and the *will* probably lose our data

## Silos won

+	people choose their friends over apps - don't want to join a cool app if there are no friends there
+	people choose their OS over apps
	+	iOS or Android instead of Facebook (Words with Friends is tied to the OS)

## Fork the web, make it your own
