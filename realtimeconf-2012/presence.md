+	availability, attention, focus
+	SSL/TLS
+	federation matters
	+	single service/silos = single point of failure/attack/control
	+	decentralized is harder but right
+	not just about people
	+	bots, servers, networks, etc
+	augment with capabilities (video, audio, location, etc)
+	XMPP over WebSocket
	+	strophe.js
+	federate or die
	+	big silos won't help with this, everyone else has to fight it
